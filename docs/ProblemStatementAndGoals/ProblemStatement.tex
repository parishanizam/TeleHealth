\section{Problem Statement}
\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}
\hspace{2em} Children with speech difficulties often require regular assessments to track 
 their progress during speech therapy. These assessments are vital in monitoring development,
 identifying issues, and adjusting treatment plans accordingly. Recently, many clinics have 
 now transitioned to offering remote speech therapy assessments, often facilitated by parents
 at home. However, existing tools lack sufficient guidance when administering these tests, 
 raising concerns about the accuracy and consistency of the results. 
 A solution is desired to guide parents in administering speech assessment at home in a way
 that reduces bias. Such a system would ensure that clinicians receive accurate information and 
 thus provide proper treatment.


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Environment}

\wss{Hardware and software environment}

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
