\section{Problem Statement}
\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}
\hspace{2em}Children with speech difficulties often require regular assessments to track their progress during speech therapy. These assessments are vital in monitoring development, identifying issues, and adjusting treatment plans accordingly. For bilingual children, these assessments can be challenging because of the shortage of bilingual  speech language pathologists (SLPs).  Parents, who are the key informants with understanding of multiple languages spoken in the home, have the potential to become helpers in bilingual assessments, especially in telehealth settings. However, existing bilingual language assessment tools are often designed and built based on SLPs’s in-person practices, and lack designs specifically addressing parents’ needs and behaviors when they act as e-helpers. The lack of such design considerations could also affect the outcome from these assessments, when SLPs need to assess and understand children’s results from remote assessments facilitated by parents. Hence, there are opportunities to build a system that better supports bilingual language assessment at home settings for children and parents, through providing better guidance and instructions for parents, capturing more contextual data to complement the results for SLPs, and engaging children in these assessments. 


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
\subsubsection{Input}
\begin{itemize}
\item Video Stream of individual taking the assessment
\item Selected answer via mouse click
\item Microphone Audio 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item Audio analysis for background noise 
\item Video analysis for keyboard and face movement
\item Analysis of the selected answers for all questions
\end{itemize}
\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parents with children that have speech difficulties
    \item Childen with speech difficulties
    \item Clinicians who work with childern that have speech difficulties
    \item Research on the project, Dr. Yao Du, clinician assisstant professor at the University of Southern California
    \item Supervisor on the project, Dr. Irene Ye Yuan, assistant professor in the department of computing and software at McMaster University
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}
\subsubsection{Software}
Software should be compatiable with Linux, MacOS and Windows operating system
\subsubsection{Hardware}
Hardware requried includes any personal computer with a speaker/headphones, webcam and microphone\\
\wss{Hardware and software environment}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intuitive and helpful interface that can guide parents to become successful e-helpers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The application should be easy to navigate with lots of signs. It should also provide feedback so that end users are aware of whats happening during the assessment.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Engaging interface and interaction for children when taking the assessment
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The webpage design should be simple but visually appealing with colors and pcitures where ever possible 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Provide reliable assessment results for SLPs by capturing additional contextual data and preliminary analysis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The application should provide additional information using audio and video analysis
    \end{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}


\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data security to ensure health/sensitive records stored and communicated securely
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The software should use an external server to store and reterive sensitive data from a protected database
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

Our challenge level is general as the project scope is limited in terms of how much research it takes. The required domain knowledge
is basic webdesign in a stack of our choice. We are also planning on using opensource LLM for audio and video processing. The extras for this project
includes add a user documentation to give more guidance to the end user and also usability testing to better understand how we can 
improve our UI design.

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
