\textbf{UIQH1: } Description.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Insert Rational\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } Insert criterion here 

\subsection{Data Collection and Storage}
\textbf{DCS1: }The database shall store multimedia files including video, audio, and structured data for 
each session.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } These file types are necessary to capture the full scope of the speech-language assessment, 
including patient responses and the structured data associated with each session.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The system must successfully store and retrieve at least 1GB of video, audio and 
structured data per session without any data corruption. \\\\
\textbf{DCS2: }The database shall record the video and audio of an assessment, flagged occurrences (e.g., errors
 or critical moments during the assessment), and timestamps for each question asked during the assessment.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Storing flagged occurrences and timestamps lets clinicians perform detailed analysis 
of patient responses and enables them to review specific moments of interest efficiently.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The database shall include video and audio files for 100 percent of recorded assessment 
sessions, and each recording must have flagged occurrences and timestamps associated with every question asked, 
 retrievable via query. \\\\
\textbf{DSC3: }The system shall not store any personally identifiable textual information (e.g., patient name, 
address, or medical record number) in the database.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } To maintain privacy and ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as HIPAA, 
identifying textual information must be excluded from storage in the database.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } A manual review and automated script shall verify that 100 percent of all records in 
the database accessible by clinicians are anonymized and contain no identifying textual information after every 
batch upload.\\\\
\textbf{DSC4: }The database shall group all stored data by a unique user identifier to ensure data can be linked 
to specific users without storing identifiable information.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Using a unique user identifier allows for data organization and retrieval by patient without 
compromising patient privacy, supporting the requirement for anonymized data storage.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The system must assign a unique identifier to every user and confirm through testing 
that all session data is properly grouped and retrievable under that identifier, with no misassociated data.\\\\

\subsection{Video and Audio Data Analysis}
\textbf{VADA1: } The system shall deploy an analysis model to analyze session data and provide insights regarding
 speech patterns and disturbances.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Automating data analysis using a model will streamline the process of identifying disturbances
 and improve the speed and accuracy of evaluations for clinicians/ speech-language pathologists\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The model must be deployed and accessible via the platform's infrastructure, 
successfully analyzing data from at least 200 assessment sessions\\\\
\textbf{VADA2: } The analysis model shall have access to the video recordings of each session for the purpose of
 processing and analyzing patient speech patterns and behavior.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } The video data contains essential visual and auditory information that the model needs to 
analyze in order to assess speech-related disturbances and non-verbal cues.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The model must successfully retrieve and process video data from 100 percent of 
completed assessment sessions without encountering data access errors.\\\\
\textbf{VADA3: } The analysis model shall identify speech disturbances, including interruptions, parental 
assistance on the assessment, or other irregularities in the background.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Detecting disturbances is critical for accurate assessment of speech disorders,
 providing clinicians/ speech-language pathologists with detailed insights for diagnosis and treatment.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The model must accurately identify and log at least 95 percent of speech disturbances 
from a set of test videos, validated against human observations.\\\\
\textbf{VADA4: } The system shall flag detected disturbances and associate them with specific timestamps in the 
video recordings for easy review by clinicians and speech-language pathologists.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Flagging disturbances and marking the exact points where they occur enables therapists to 
quickly review the relevant portions of the assessment, reducing the time needed for manual analysis.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } For each session, the model must flag at least 95 percent of disturbances and attach 
the corresponding timestamps, retrievable by query during session review.\\\\

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
