\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Authentication}
\textbf{FR-A1: } The system shall allow a user to choose between a Parent or Clinician account prior to logging in.\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Users must be associated with the correct permissions determined by their role, which includes the level of information they have access to.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } Users must be able to directly select their account type prior to logging in.\\

\textbf{FR-A2: } The system shall allow a user to create a parent account with a unique username which does not exist in the database.\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Users must be able to create a unique account for parents to login for the assessment.\\

\textbf{Rationale: } Users must be able to select their best option to answer the question.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The system must indicate to the user their selected response.\\

\textbf{FR-AI5: } The system shall allow a user to confirm their selection.\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Users must be able to confirm their selection to proceed to the next stage.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } Users must be brought to the next stage upon confirming their selection.\\

\textbf{FR-AI6: } The system shall keep track of the user's current question.\\
\textbf{Rationale: } The system must be able to keep track of the time the user enters and exits each question, to synchronize with the audio and video recordings.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The system must store the user's timestamps upon completing each question.\\

\textbf{FR-AI7: } The system shall inform the user about the assessment's completion.\\
\textbf{Rationale: } The system must inform the user of the test's completion to indicate they can exit the system.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The user must be informed about the test's completion upon confirming the selection of the final question.\\

\subsection{Data Collection and Storage}
\textbf{DCS1: }The database shall store multimedia files including video, audio, and JSON format files for each session.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } These file types are necessary to capture the full scope of the speech-language assessment, 
including patient responses and the structured data associated with each session (e.g., flagged occurrences, 
timestamps).\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The system must successfully store and retrieve at least 1GB of video, audio, and JSON 
data per session without data corruption. \\\\
\textbf{DCS2: }The database shall record the video, audio, flagged occurrences (e.g., errors or critical moments
 during the assessment), and timestamps for each question asked during the assessment.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Storing flagged occurrences and timestamps lets clinicians perform detailed analysis 
of patient responses and enables them to review specific moments of interest efficiently.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The database shall include video and audio files for 100 percent of assessment sessions,
 and each recording must have flagged occurrences and timestamps associated with every question asked, 
 retrievable via query. \\\\
\textbf{DSC3: }The system shall not store any personally identifiable textual information (e.g., patient name, address, 
or medical record number) in the database.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } To maintain privacy and ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as HIPAA, 
identifying textual information must be excluded from storage in the database.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } ??.\\\\
\textbf{DSC4: }The database shall group all stored data by a unique user identifier to ensure data can be linked to 
specific users without storing identifiable information.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Using a unique user identifier allows for data organization and retrieval by patient without 
compromising patient privacy, supporting the requirement for anonymized data storage.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } The system must assign a unique identifier to every user and confirm through testing 
that all session data is properly grouped and retrievable under that identifier, with no misassociated data.\\\\
\textbf{DSC5: }Description.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Insert Rational\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } Insert criterion here\\

\textbf{VADA1: } Description.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } Insert Rational\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } Insert criterion here \\\\
\textbf{VADA2: } The analysis model shall have access to the video recordings of each session for the purpose of processing
 and analyzing patient speech patterns and behavior.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: } The video data contains essential visual and auditory information that the model needs to analyze in order to assess speech-related disturbances and non-verbal cues.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: } Insert criterion here \\\\

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
