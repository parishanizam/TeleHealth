\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\hspace{2em}The project being outlined in this document is an at-home bilingual speech 
assessment system with video and audio analysis features. The system is designed 
to provide clear guidance to parents when administering the assessment to their 
children, in an environment where speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are 
unavailable. By streamlining the assessment process, the project aims to provide a 
convenient and comprehensive solution for SLPs to assess and support their patients'
speech and language development remotely. 
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.2.1] \textbf{Intuitive Parent Interface:}  
  The system must provide an intuitive interface that helps parents administer 
  language assessments effectively. It should be easy to navigate with clear and 
  meaningful symbols, and it must provide real-time feedback to ensure parents are 
  aware their interactions are being processed throughout the assessment.

  \item[1.2.2] \textbf{Engaging Child Interaction:}  
  The system must feature an engaging interface for children to keep them attentive 
  during the assessment. The design should be simple yet visually appealing, using 
  colors and images to attract the child’s attention to the questions and selections,
  ensuring that children remain engaged throughout the assessment.

  \item[1.2.3] \textbf{Reliable Assessment Data for SLPs:}  
  The system must provide reliable and accurate assessment data for speech-language 
  pathologists (SLPs) by capturing additional contextual data. This includes 
  identifying background interference, signs of bias, and potential test 
  complications. The system should also filter out noise and detect multiple users 
  to prevent external guidance from affecting the assessment results.

  \item[1.2.4] \textbf{Data Security:}  
  The system must ensure that all sensitive health and personal data is securely 
  stored and accessed. It should implement a strong security protocol to securely 
  store, retrieve, and manage sensitive data, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality
  of the users.

  \item[1.2.5] \textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility:}  
  The system must provide cross-platform compatibility, ensuring that it functions 
  seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. It should be accessible to 
  both parents and children, rendering correctly on all screen formats, whether on 
  phones, tablets, or desktops.

\subsection{Data Collection and Storage}
\textbf{FR-DCS1: }The database shall store multimedia files including video, audio, and structured data for 
each session.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Video and audio files will provide extra information such as parent interference and 
other forms of bias/ cheating on the assessment.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The system must successfully store and retrieve at least 1GB of video, audio and 
structured data per session without any data corruption. \\\\
\textbf{FR-DSC2: }The system shall not store any personally identifiable textual information (e.g., patient name, 
address, or medical record number) in the database.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }To maintain privacy and ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as HIPAA, 
identifying textual information must be excluded from storage in the database.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }An automated process shall verify and confirm that 100\% of records in the database 
accessible by clinicians are anonymized and contain no identifying textual information.\\\\
\textbf{FR-DSC3: }The database shall group all stored data by a unique user identifier to ensure data can be linked 
to specific users without storing identifiable information.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Using a unique user identifier allows for data organization and retrieval by patient without 
compromising patient privacy, supporting the requirement for anonymized data storage.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The system must assign a unique identifier to every user and confirm through testing 
that 100\% of session data is properly grouped and retrievable under that identifier, with no misassociated 
data.\\\\

\subsection{Video and Audio Data Analysis}
\textbf{FR-VADA1: }The analysis model shall have access to the video and audio recordings of each session.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }The data contains essential visual and auditory information that can help clinicians 
efficiently assess any speech-related disturbances and non-verbal cues.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The model must successfully retrieve and process video data from 100\% of 
completed assessment sessions without encountering data access errors.\\\\
\textbf{FR-VADA2: }The analysis model shall identify speech disturbances, including interruptions, parental 
assistance on the assessment, or other irregularities in the background.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Detecting disturbances is critical for accurate assessment of speech disorders without 
bias so that clinicians and speech language pathologists can accurately provide diagnosis and treatment.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The model must accurately identify and log at least 95\% of speech disturbances 
from a set of test videos, validated against human observations.\\\\
\textbf{FR-VADA3: }The system shall flag detected disturbances and associate them with specific timestamps in the 
video recordings.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Flagging disturbances and marking the exact points where they occur enables clinicians and 
speech-language pathologists to quickly review the relevant portions of the assessment, reducing the time needed 
for manual analysis.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }For each session, the model must accurately attach time stamps to disturbances
identified in VADA2 with at least 95\% accuracy.\\\\

\subsection{Data Processing and Display}
\textbf{FR-DPD1: }The system shall retrieve processed assessment results from the database for report generation.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }In order to generate reports, the system must access and extract the necessary data from the database, ensuring that all relevant assessment information is included.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The system shall successfully retrieve all assessment data without errors within 10 seconds of a query being made.\\
\\
\noindent\textbf{FR-DPD2: }The system shall automatically generate a comprehensive report based on the retrieved assessment data, including flagged occurrences, timestamps, and patient performance metrics.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Automatically generating a report provides a streamlined process for clinicians to review the patient’s performance, saving time on manual data compilation.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The report must include all of the required data for each session, and must be generated within 10 seconds of the request.\\
\\
\noindent\textbf{FR-DPD3: }The system shall display the generated report in a user-friendly format, accessible through the platform’s interface.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Clinicians need to be able to easily view and interpret the report to assess patient progress and determine next steps for therapy.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The report must be displayed within the clinician's dashboard, formatted with charts and tables where applicable, and fully load within 10 seconds.\\
\\
\noindent\textbf{FR-DPD4: }The system shall store the generated report in the database, linked to the corresponding patient’s unique user identifier.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Storing the report ensures that clinicians can access previous assessment results, enabling them to track patient progress over time.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }The report must be stored in the database with a unique identifier and timestamp, and be retrievable for at least 7 years after creation.\\
\\
\noindent\textbf{FR-DPD5: }Clinicians shall be able to securely access previously generated reports from the database at any time.\\
\textit{Insert formal Specification}\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Clinicians need on-demand access to reports to monitor progress and make informed treatment decisions during follow-up sessions.\\
\textbf{Fit criterion: }Clinicians must be able to access 100\% of stored reports within 10 seconds.\\
