\section{Introduction}

The following document details the Module Interface Specifications for TeleHealth Insights. It is an at-home bilingual speech 
assessment system with video and audio analysis features. The system is designed 
to provide clear guidance to parents when administering the assessment to their 
children, in an environment where speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are 
unavailable. By streamlining the assessment process, the project aims to provide a 
convenient and comprehensive solution for SLPs to assess and support their patients'
speech and language development remotely.

Complementary documents include the System Requirement Specifications
and Module Guide.  The full documentation and implementation can be

\section{Notation}

\wss{You should describe your notation.  You can use what is below as
  a starting point.}

The structure of the MIS for modules comes from \citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995},
with the addition that template modules have been adapted from
\cite{GhezziEtAl2003}.  The mathematical notation comes from Chapter 3 of
\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.  For instance, the symbol := is used for a
multiple assignment statement and conditional rules follow the form $(c_1
\Rightarrow r_1 | c_2 \Rightarrow r_2 | ... | c_n \Rightarrow r_n )$.

The following table summarizes the primitive data types used by \progname. 

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\noindent 
\begin{tabular}{l l p{7.5cm}} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ 
\midrule
character & char & a single symbol or digit\\
integer & $\mathbb{Z}$ & a number without a fractional component in (-$\infty$, $\infty$) \\
natural number & $\mathbb{N}$ & a number without a fractional component in [1, $\infty$) \\
real & $\mathbb{R}$ & any number in (-$\infty$, $\infty$)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\noindent
The specification of \progname \ uses some derived data types: sequences, strings, and
tuples. Sequences are lists filled with elements of the same data type. Strings
are sequences of characters. Tuples contain a list of values, potentially of
different types. In addition, \progname \ uses functions, which
are defined by the data types of their inputs and outputs. Local functions are
described by giving their type signature followed by their specification.

\section{Module Decomposition}

The following table is taken directly from the Module Guide document for this project.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
  \\Promish: I think as a group we were very coordinated and had the important parts, like the module
  hierarchy diagram, completed before our TA meeting. This allowed us to ask Chris if our design looked good and if 
  there was any feedback he could provide.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them? \\
    \\Promish: The hardest part of this deliverable is knowing that right after it, we have to build everything within three weeks.
    I found myself second-guessing between what would make a good design and what would make a feasible design. We overcame
    this by talking to our supervisor and setting up a good timeline.
  \item Which of your design decisions stemmed from speaking to your client(s)
  or a proxy (e.g., your peers, stakeholders, potential users)? For those that
  were not, why, and where did they come from? \\
  \\Promish: Most of the design came from prior knowledge of working in co-op as a backend and frontend developer.
  We also had our supervisor help with the frontend UI design, as there was a mock-up of what she wanted overall or what she didn't like.
  \item While creating the design doc, what parts of your other documents (e.g.,
  requirements, hazard analysis, etc.), if any, needed to be changed, and why? \\
  \\Promish: Nothing needed to change as we had already discussed in-depth what we were building and had regular meetups with our supervisor.
  We referenced the SRS to ensure that our design met our goals and extended goals, but we didn't have to change any previous document because of our design.
  \item What are the limitations of your solution? Put another way, given
  unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions) \\
  \\Promish: I would say a big limitation is the time aspect of making the capstone. I feel like given more time, we would be able to build it like an agile team,
  so that features are constantly tested with users. We are also limited in terms of getting video metadata, so the accuracy of our video analysis might suffer because of that.
  Finally, we are also limited by our skills; there are some aspects of the design that we couldn't do because we didn't know how to and didn't have the time to figure it out.
  \item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered. What
  are the benefits and trade-offs of those other designs compared with the chosen
  design? From all the potential options, why did you select the documented design?
  (LO\_Explores) \\
  \\Promish: For our backend, we thought about a monolithic architecture style because it would be easier to implement, but the trade-off is that it's not as maintainable.
  Our supervisor stressed that maintainability is a big priority for her, so we ended up going with a microservice architecture style. We also considered the various interactions between how
  the clinician and the parent UI. We previously thought about the parent making an account and the clinician would just search for the parent to add them to their client list. However,
  we thought it was best if the clinician added the parent to their client list and then gave them a code. This way, we would reduce troll accounts and other security gaps.
