\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

As this project does not have existing implementations, this section is not appropriate for the TeleHealth Insights project.

\section{Unit Testing}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\hspace{2em} Throughout testing, important changes to the system were identified that will be implemented into Revision 1.
Feedback is based on pilot usability testing with fellow software engineering students, graduates from McMaster, and the team's
supervisor, following the Revision 0 demo. The changes identiifed are aimed at enhancing the functionality and usability of the system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Parent Results Accessibility} Inititally, the system was not capable of displaying the results to the parents. Upon conversations
    with the team's supervisor, it became clear that a missing feature that would benefit users of the system is for parents to have access to
    their own past assessment information. Clarity in communication surrounding their child's results is integral for conversation amongst
    parents and clinicians to see how the child's progress overtime.
  \item \textbf{Uploading Results Require Clearer Communication} Initially, to upload results, the user would press a 'submit' button on the last question
    of their assessment. Upon clicking this button, text would appear to inform the user that their results were being uploaded. However, feedback from
    the team's usability testing revealed that users would appreciate a loading screen, or a loading indicator on the screen, rather than static text
    to effectively communicate that results are still being uploaded. Users were previously confused on whether or not the system was operating properly,
    or if it froze, due to the lack of a loading indicator.
  \item \textbf{Simplify Tutorials} The tutorial screens consisted of a variety of screenshots and descriptions, informing users of what they could expect
    to see from the system upon completion of the tutorial. However, upon conducting usability testing, numerous users were confused by the tutorial,
    and thought that the screenshots themselves were interactable buttons, as they were screenshots of the system. Tutorials will be modified to convey
    integral information to the user about the assessment itself, and minimize repetition of information by reducing screenshots of the system. The section
    of the tutorial users appreciated was the step-by-step walkthrough of a sample question. The tutorial will be reformulated to put a larger emphasis on
    walking users through the system, instead of displaying static information.
  \item \textbf{Uploading Assessment Videos} The team's supervisor expressed through feedback that the system was not effective at uploading assessment videos.
    Upon inspection, the team updated the deployed system to allow for faster upload speeds, resulting in a better user experience when completing assessments.
    This is of particular importance to the team, as the full assessment will be 30 questions, while the usability test featured only 5 questions. In addition,
    the system will be used by children, which may lengthen the assessment duration as well.

\section{Automated Testing}

\subsection{Linters}
To maintain a good coding standard, we integrated linters into
our development workflow. For JavaScript files, we rely on Prettier to
automatically format code, ensuring consistent indentation and spacing.
By running Prettier as part of our pre-commit checks, any formatting concerns
are addressed before merging into our main repository, which helps minimize merge
conflicts and maintain a clean codebase.

\subsection{Unit Testing}
We use Jest as our primary JavaScript testing framework to automatically verify critical parts 
of our code before changes are merged into the main branch. This approach helps us catch issues 
early, maintain code quality, and keep the overall system stable.

\subsection{Continuous Integration}
We used continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate test execution
and provide immediate feedback whenever new code is committed. We configure GitHub
Actions trigger to run our Jest unit tests, linters and document tests on each pull request 
or direct push to main, ensuring that only code meeting quality standards is always met.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
\hspace{2em}This section covers the code coverage metrics summary for all files in our backend. The code coverage values are given as percentages of code covered
utilizing Jest. Services such as authenticaition-service and media-processing-service have greater code coverage as they were a bigger part of our system thus we wrote more 
unit tests for them.

  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
