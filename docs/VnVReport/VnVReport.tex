\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

As this project does not have existing implementations, this section is not appropriate for the TeleHealth Insights project.

\section{Unit Testing}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\section{Automated Testing}

\subsection{Linters}
To maintain a good coding standard, we integrated linters into
our development workflow. For JavaScript files, we rely on Prettier to
automatically format code, ensuring consistent indentation and spacing.
By running Prettier as part of our pre-commit checks, any formatting concerns
are addressed before merging into our main repository, which helps minimize merge
conflicts and maintain a clean codebase.

\subsection{Unit Testing}
We use Jest as our primary JavaScript testing framework to automatically verify critical parts 
of our code before changes are merged into the main branch. This approach helps us catch issues 
early, maintain code quality, and keep the overall system stable.

\subsection{Continuous Integration}
We used continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate test execution
and provide immediate feedback whenever new code is committed. We configure GitHub
Actions trigger to run our Jest unit tests, linters and document tests on each pull request 
or direct push to main, ensuring that only code meeting quality standards is always met.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
