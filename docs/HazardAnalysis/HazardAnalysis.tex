\section{Introduction}

\hspace{1.5em} This document contains the hazard analysis for Telehealth Insights, a project for a website that will help 
parents administer language tests at home for bilingual children with speech difficulties. A hazard is defined as a 
property or condition in a system that when combined with a condition in the environment has the potential to harm or 
damage to the system. A hazard is not limited to safety, it can also be related to system security, user sensitivity and 
unexpected human or technology interactions. The purpose of this document is to identify any hazards to the project, and 
develop newsafety and security requirements from a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\hspace{1.5em} The hazard analysis focuses on identifying, evaluating, and mitigating any hazards that could negatively 
impact the speech language assessment platofrm. This includes both technical and user interaction hazards in particular 
since the project will include handling sensitive patient data. The analysis will cover many aspects of the system such as 
data handling, software stability and user sensitivity. \\
\indent The purpose of the hazard analysis is to identify any risks that could 
affect data privacy and security, system reliability, data collection accuracy, and compliance with relevant standards. A 
hazzrd analysis minimizes these risks, as the loss from unaddressed hazards could involve patient safety, data breaches, 
and legal or financial consequences for the assessment organization.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
