\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will meet in-person at least once a week every Monday from 3:30-4:30 pm. Exceptions to this 
may include when the University is closed, statuatory holidays, or a group consensus to postpone the meeting
is agreed upon. Additional meetings can be held in person or virtually through the team's discord server on 
a per need basis. Location and timing will be decided as a group at least 3 hours in advance. Team meetings will
be structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 5-10 minutes of progress check-in 
  \item 5 minutes of agenda debrief
  \item 40 minutes of executing the agenda
  \item 5-10 minutes of discussing next steps
\end{itemize}
The meeting chair will be decided at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, and rotate on a weekly basis.

Meetings with the project's supervisor will take place in-person every Tuesday from 9:45-10:15 am. Exceptions 
to this may include when the University is closed, statuatory holidays, or a group consensus to postpone the 
meeting is agreed upon.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

Communication is essential for a successful project. The following is an outline of how the team will 
communicate, the tools/platforms we will use, and the expectations for each team member regarding communication.

Communication Tools
\begin{itemize}
  \item Github: a github repository will be used for code versioning, project tracking, and technical documentation. 
  Additional details are as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Project board: used to track milestones and visualize the workflow of the project using Kanban style columns
    \item Issues: used to keep track of tasks and meetings, and delegating tasks among team members. Labels are used
     to categorize issues.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Discord: a discord server will be used for day-to-day communication and online meetings. Below outlines the 
  discord server structure:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item general: text channel for general updates, quick questions and informal discussions
    \item documents-and-resources: text channel for relevant files or useful links that do not belong in the github 
    project folder
    \item meetings: text channel for co-ordinating ad-hoc meetings between some or all team members.
    \item external-meetings: text channel for co-ordinating and reviewing meeting agendas with individuals 
    outside the core capstone team (e.g. capstone supervisor).
    \item help: text channel for questions or issues that need prioritized attention.
    \item Office: voice channel to hold any online meetings.
  \end{itemize}
  \item E-mail: school emails will be used to communicate with individuals outside the core capstone team such as the 
  capstone supervisor, capstone professor, external professionals, etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Member Roles}

All team members are responsible for writing documentation, coding, testing, and creating/commenting on issues no 
matter their role.

\end{tabularx}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Git Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The main branch will contain code that has been approved, tested, and is considered production-ready by 
  the team.
	\item Branches will be created based on deliverables, features, or bug fixes and be named clearly based on their 
  purpose (e.g. problem-statement, development-plan, front-end/navbar, etc.) 
  \item Once the deliverable, feature or bug fix is completed and merged into the main branch it may be deleted.
	\item Once a deliverable or bug fix is complete, a pull request will be made. The PR description will include:
	\begin{itemize}
    \item The purpose of the change
    \item The issue number it addresses with a link to the issue
    \item Details of testing and/or any relevant references
  \end{itemize}
	\item All PRs require at least one teammate to review it, with the exception of documentation updates that are 
  able to automatically merge.
	\item GitHub PR comments will be used to provide feedback
	\item Issues will be created on Git for project management (see 7.2)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issue Management}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Every new task (documentation, features, bugs, updates, meetings) will be logged as a GitHub Issue.
	\item Team members may either use one of the provided templates or create a blank issue. For blank issues, 
  they must include:
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Title that gives a clear overview of the issue
    \item Description of the task, including any necessary background or context
    \item Links to related issues necessary for the completion of the current issue if applicable.
    \item Label tags, Milestone category, and Project assignment*.
    \item Assignees
  \end{itemize}
  \item *Label tags are based on the type of issue (e.g. documentation), milestone categories 
  are the type of deliverable (e.g. Development Plan), and all issues are displayed on one project board (see 8.1)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use of CI/CD}
\begin{itemize}
	\item GitHub Actions will be used to create and manage continuous integration workflow scripts.
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Running a code linting tool and automatically enforcing style guides
    \item restricting the ability to merge pull requests that do not meet our coding standards (see section 11)
    \item Ensure that the code builds successfully on each push
  \end{itemize}
	\item If all tests pass, a pull request may be merged into a branch.
	\item The lead developer will ensure all necessary code is covered by automated tests.
	\item A rollback strategy will be included in the CD pipeline in case the project needs 
  to be reverted to a previously stable state.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\subsection{GitHub Projects}

GitHub Projects will be used to manage and keep track of the project's schedule. 
The link to our project board can be found \href{https://github.com/users/parishanizam/projects/2/views/1}{here}
The project board is organized by rows and columns, where each row is a different 
milestone that can be minimized and expanded, and each column is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Backlog: Issues that have assigned low priority
  \item To Do: Newly created issues
  \item In Progress: Issues actively being worked on
  \item In Review: Issues awaiting approval from other teammates
  \item Done: Completed Issues
\end{itemize}
Each issue is categorized into a milestone, and team members will update their statuses as they 
progress through the project deliverables.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

1. Video Implementation 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The main risk and most challenging aspect of this project is for the system to collect video data that will be sufficiently accurate for us to store and analyze. 
  These at home assessments will be done in different settings with varying lightings, and camera qualities. Ensuring that video capturing remains complete and accurate across all settings presents a significant challenge.  Video integration also poses the risk of compromising data security. As we are handling videos of children and parents, it is important to maintain security. Video data should be encrypted during the storage and processing to ensure privacy of the clients and be compliant to privacy standards. \\  
  \item POC Plan: To address this risk, the POC demonstratation will focus on the applications ability to accuratly record and store video data. Playback of an example will be shown to ensure data was captured succesfully. The recording will than be processed using our created model. 
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Will a part of the implementation be difficult?}
Technologies such as using video \& video recording with analytics, and using machine learning are relatively new to members on the team due to no experience in these areas. Research and using open source models recommeded by Dr. Irene will assist in making the implementation less difficult. \\

\subsection{Will testing be difficult?} 
Unit testing will initially not be difficult as each developer in charge of creating and testng the code they have written. We will also being using automated testing using CI and testing libraries including Jest and PyTest to assist. Receiving mock data and real data for final testing may be more challenging. \\

\subsection{Is a required library difficult to install?}
No there are no current libraries that will be difficult to install or use. Most our team members have used before or popular libraries have documentation to follow.\\

\pagebreak

\subsection{Will portability be a concern?}
portability will not be a concern. We will be starting with a web-based application that can be opened on any device. We have chosen to use the framwork Expo to easily integrate the application as a mobile application on cross platforms including IOS and android.\\


\textbf{Proof of Concept Demonstration}

A walkthrough of a simple mock assessment process on the application involving two users; a child and parent. The assesement will be completed on a laptop using integrated video. POC will demonstrate the ability of the web based application to do the following: \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Turn on the camera: Request permission access to camera on laptop and display live video feed.
  \item Start recording: Begin assessment by clicking start recording
  \item Start \& complete Assement: assesement wil be completed with various prompts and questions
  \item Stop recording: Click Stop recording
  \item Save \& store recording securely: Video will be saved securely on to our database and logged
  \item Playback of video to confirm accuracy and proper storage: Find video in storage and playback
  \item Recording starts being processed by backend system
  \item Show results of video analytics to determine detection of any guidance using Machine Learning
\end{itemize}

The POC will also be done on two different devices to ensure it works on different settings and systems.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the project?}

There are several reasons why it is important to create a development plan before starting a project.
It provides a high level overview of the entire project from start to finish, which gives the team a 
clear direction. Documenting the goals, scope, and timeline helps the team understand the project early 
on. This familiarity leads to more efficient project management.

A development plan also helps identify any necessary tools and resources that will be used. Along with the 
goals, scope and timeline, this information can help a team identify challenges and risks before they occur,
and allows them to plan ahead and implement strategies to reduce these risks and challenges. 

Additionally, the development plan details team roles, meeting schedules, communication standards and a 
team charter. This sets accountability for each team member and clarifies each persons role and responsibilities,
resulting in a more collaborative and consistent working environment.

In summary, creating a development plan to define objectives and team expectations before starting the project 
reduces misunderstandings, improves collaboration and communication, and overall leads to a smoother project execution. 

\subsection*{In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using CI/CD?}

Using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in a software development project offers several 
advantages. Firstly, automating testing and deployment reduces the time needed to be spent on repeating the same tests which
leads to efficient and more frequent updates. The automated process can help catch bugs early on, improve code quality 
and minimize errors. It can also keep track of which commits caused which bugs to be introduced, improving organization
and traceability. The quick feedback and blocking pull requests until all tests pass when updating the codebase allows 
the developers to address problems quickly which improves overall productivity and project efficiency.

A disadvantage of CI/CD is that it requires significant time and resources to set up properly in the beginning of a 
project, especially if a team has a lot of things they would like to achieve using CI/CD. If a lot of tests are set up, 
Not all tests may be necessary for all code updates, and there could be a lot of processing time for only a little 
benefit in some cases. It also may give the team a false sense of security that the code has been fully checked, 
and some boundary cases or errors may go unnoticed because of overly relying on the automated tests. CI/CD has a 
lot of possibilities regarding automation and testing, 

\subsection*{What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any, and how did you resolve them?}

For this current deliverable (Problem Statement, POC and Development Plan), our group did not have any disagreements.

\newpage{}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item Have something meaningful and interesting to talk about in interviews.
\item Get a 12 in the Capstone Course.
\item Design a project that's meaningful and impactful with the purpose of helping people.
\item Have an interesting, engaging, and interactive demonstration at the Capstone EXPO.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\indent The team's expectations regarding meeting attendance are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Arrive on time to the agreed upon location.
  \item If a team member is running late, they should message in the team's Discord Server, indicating how far away they are.
  \item If a team member needs to leave early, they should communicate with the team ahead of time, or within the first 5 minutes of the meeting. It is their responsibility to catch up on missed content by asking team members.
  \item If a team member needs to miss a meeting, they should inform all team members, and make a plan on how they will catch up on the missed contributions. They should refer to the remaining team members to get caught up.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

Acceptable Excuses for missing a meeting or a deadline include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Personal Emergency: Family or Personal
  \item Illness: Includes Mental Health
\end{itemize}

Unacceptable Excuses for missing a meeting or a deadline include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Technical Issues: Problems with computers or the internet can be avoided through prior planning or team communication
  \item Conflicting Workload: All team members have a full course load, but are all committed to the capstone course as well.
  \item Miscommunication or Confusion: If team members are confused about details, they should openly discuss it, and not let it delay their work.
  \item Prior Commitments: Team members should organize their schedules accordingly to avoid prior commitments and scheduling conflicts from taking precedence over their work.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

In the case of an emergency, team members must inform the rest of the team about their absence.
They do not need to state the reason aside from there being an emergency (as it may be personal).\\
\indent Team members must communicate how far they got into their individual task, and what still needs to be completed
(if they were not able to complete their task). In the case where their task has not been completed, they must
decide whether they are able to complete their individual task (delayed), or if they need to transfer
the responsibility to another team member.\\
\indent In the case their responsibility is transferred to another team member, they should communicate with said
team member how they will catch up for one of their individual tasks in the future (so equal distribution
of work is achieved by the end of the project).

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

The team's expectations regarding the quality of team members' preparation for team meetings
is for all work discussed to be completed prior to the team meeting is actually completed so
that the team can continue to progress to the next task or milestone.\\
\indent The team's expectations regarding the quality of deliverables is to strive for level
4's in every rubric, and to frequently refer to rubrics and guidelines to ensure each member
is on track. Team members should review each others' work prior to submission, along with
cross-checking against the posted rubrics to ensure all guidelines are met
(and in some cases, exceeded).


\subsubsection*{Attitude}

The team's expectations regarding team members' ideas are to go in with an open-mind, and to
hear all ideas out in their entirety before coming to conclusions. This will allow all ideas
to be expressed and acknowledged.\\
\indent The team's expectations regarding interactions with each other are to maintain respect
for one another, regardless of potential conflicts or disruptions. If disagreements lead to tension,
it should be figured out and openly discussed as soon as possible to come to resolutions so the team
does not suffer as a result.\\
\indent The team's expectations regarding cooperation is to feel comfortable approaching any team member
for support and help, with proper credit given. Team members should be willing to collaborate and cooperate
with other members, as it will benefit the whole team, and the final grade they will receive in the course.
In the instance that team members are over-reliant on one another, team members can express themselves to the
individual or the team, try to better understand the situation, and work towards a solution.\\
\indent The team's expectations regarding attitudes is to try to stay positive and look towards solutions, instead
of dwelling on problems. In times of stress, team members should acknowledge their own state, and not take their
frustrations out on the rest of the team. The team will support its members through periods of stress.\\
\indent Team members should contribute equally to milestones. In the case where team members feel the work has been
split unfairly, team members can express their concerns to the whole team, and the workload can be adjusted accordingly.\\
\indent The team will adapt a conflict resolution plan:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Clarify the source of the problem and describe the conflict.
  \item Identify and understand differing viewpoints (including barriers of understanding).
  \item Establish a common goal.
  \item Find a course of action (solution) that both sides can agree to that addresses the issue.
  \item Agree on the course of action (solution).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\indent The team will stay on track by employing frequent (1-2 times a week, depending on the milestone)
check-ins among team members to discuss the work they've completed in the past week, along with
what they are currently working on.\\
\indent Further, the team will also employ the use of the Professor's Google Calendar to ensure deadlines are met.\\
\indent In addition, the work will be completed at-least 1 day prior to the deadline to give the team time to check over
the work, compare against rubrics, address concerns, and reflect.\\
\indent Also, the team will break down milestones into smaller tasks using issues to keep track of individual tasks.\\

\indent The team will reward members who do well by going out for an additional team social, to celebrate their accomplishments.
The team will manage members whose performance is below expectations by communicating first with the member
about their output, and address it to them as an issue. If the behaviour does not change, the team can ask a member
to speak with the TA for advice. If after implementing the advice, the behaviour still does not change, the issue can
be addressed to the professor.\\
\indent The consequences for someone not contributing their fair share include: potential loss on peer evaluation, a discussion
with the TA/professor, or a difference/loss of grades (in comparison to the team's final grade).

Target Metrics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attendance: 95\% of all team meetings
  \item Commits: 
  \item Confirm review of all documents prior to submission
  \item Confirm review of all rubric criteria prior to submission
\end{itemize}

If someone doesn't hit their targets they must explain which target they didn't meet and why.\\
\indent If the targets are repeatedly not met, the team must make an appointment with the TA to discuss strategies on
how to better achieve these targets, and ensure equal contribution among the team.\\
\indent The incentive for reaching targets early is an additional vote on where to host the next team social.\\

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

The team will build cohesion through (minimum) monthly team socials.\\
\indent The details of the events will be decided upon unanimously, during a time of low-stress,
that works for all team members.

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

The team will make decisions through consensus, as voting could lead to solutions that
not every member is comfortable with.\\
\indent The team will handle disagreements through openly stating their viewpoints and
reasoning, and all team members will share their views on the benefits and drawbacks of
the strategies to reach a conclusion that works for everyone.
