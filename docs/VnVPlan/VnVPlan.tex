\hspace{2 em} This document contains the team's verification and validation plan for the TeleHealth
Insights project. This document features general information, overall plan, system tests,
the eventual addition of unit tests, and usability survey questions.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

  The software being tested TeleHealth Insights, is a web-based at-home bilingual
  speech assessment system with video and audio analysis features. The system is designed to provide clear 
  guidance to parents when administering the assessment to their children, in an environment where speech-language
  pathologists (SLPs) are unavailable. By streamlining the assessment pro-
  cess, the project aims to provide a convenient and comprehensive solution
  for SLPs to assess and support their patient's speech and language development remotely.

  TeleHealth System comprises of several software components to efficiently provide 
  a platform for children assessments to occur while actively recording for clinicians to review and analyze. 

  \subsubsection{User Interface}

  We must ensure that the interface is easy to navigate for all stakeholders involved, the parents, 
  clinicians as well as the parents. The system should be simple and testing will include ensuring 
  there is an intuitive layouts, clear instructions and labels, as well as a logical workflow.

  \subsubsection{Video and Audio Recording}

  Ensure set up of hardware devices used on application is intuitive and done properly. 

  \subsubsection{Video and Audio Analysis}

  Integrate web-based application to store recorded audio and video footage. The system will be tested to ensure it is able to 
  appropriately analyze and identify flags and bias when conducting assessments. The analyzed data should be presented 
  in a easy to understand representation

  \subsection{Objectives}

The VnV Plan aims to evaluate whether the system meets key project goals in terms of recording quality, AI performance, data security, and ease of use. The following subsections clarify the scope and definitions of the main objectives within the context of this project.

\subsubsection{Ensure Accuracy and Correctness of Software Reading and Identifying Bias}
The primary objective of this VnV Plan is to ensure that the system can:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Correctly record video and audio: The system should capture audio and video that meet minimum quality thresholds, such as resolution, clarity, and synchronization between video and audio streams, as defined in performance requirements (Section 4.2.3).
  \item Accurately detect disturbances or bias: The AI analysis models should flag disturbances (e.g., background noise, occluded faces, off-task behavior) and potential assessment biases (e.g., speech delays, distracted environment) with a predefined success rate (e.g., \texttt{VERY\_HIGH\_SUCCESS\_RATE}) in comparison with human-reviewed ground truth.
  \item Provide valid outputs: Results of the analysis should be correctly summarized in clinician-facing dashboards or reports, with visualizations that align with recorded content.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security and Authentication}
The second objective is to verify that the system enforces strong authentication protocols and protects sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data privacy and encryption: All assessment recordings and user data must be securely stored and encrypted both at rest and in transit, meeting compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, as referenced in Section 4.2.8).
  \item Role-based access control: Only authorized users should be able to perform role-specific tasks:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Parents can complete assessments with their children.
      \item Clinicians can view assessment results and recordings.
      \item Admins can manage account creation and system configuration.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Access restrictions: Attempts by unauthorized users to access protected interfaces or data must be detected and blocked.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Demonstrate Usability}
The final objective is to confirm that the system is intuitive and accessible for parents, children, and clinicians. In this context:
\begin{itemize}
  \item User-friendly interface: The UI should follow best practices in accessibility, clarity, and layout. Users should be able to perform common tasks (e.g., starting an assessment, reviewing results) with minimal instructions and no more than a defined number of clicks (\texttt{MAX\_CLICKS}).
  \item Efficient task completion: Success is measured by user testing metrics (e.g., task completion rate, time to complete), and feedback collected via the usability survey in the Appendix (Section 6.2).
  \item Child accessibility: The assessment interface must be suitable for children aged 6â€“12, who should be able to navigate the assessment independently (Section 4.2.2).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Out of Scope}
Some objectives that are considered out of scope for this VnV plan due to resource limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Adherence to UI Industry Standards: Full compliance with all published UI standards is not feasible due to time constraints. The focus is on practical usability and functional aesthetics rather than exhaustive WCAG or HIG compliance.
  \item Verification of Third-Party Libraries: External open-source libraries used in the frontend or AI model will not be independently audited. Instead, system-level testing will ensure that their integration functions as expected.
\end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsubsection{Challenge Level} 

Our challenge level is general as the project scope is limited in terms of how much
research is required. The required domain knowledge is basic web-design in a
stack of our choice. We are also planning on using open-source large language
models for audio and video processing.

\subsubsection{Extras}
Our project has the following extras;
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User Documentation: } Providing users with a guide on how to use and
  better understand the system. 
  \item \textbf{Usability Testing: } Receive user feedback on usability of design of the application, 
including improvements on how the system looks and functions. This will help to ensure an 
intuitive and easy system for both clinicians and parents/children to navigate through.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

  The three main relevant documentation that helped guide us in System Verification and Validation Plan (VnV) was Software Requirements Specification
  (SRS), Development plan and MIS.  
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The SRS document was crucial to define descriptions, rationals and fit criteria for all of the systems main functional 
    and non functional requirements. This outlines the basis of what needs to be verified and tested in the VnV Plan. It also outlines the 
    traceability matrix that needs to be followed.
    \item Development Plan: Defined the main Goals, Objectives and extras for the system, aiding the team to understand what
     needs to be done and focused on. 
    \item MIS : The Module Interface Specification (MIS) will shape the scope of unit testing in the VnV plan and guides 
    the development of both functional and nonfunctional tests to verify specific software functions and attributes.
  \end{itemize}

  \caption{Verification and Validation Team Table}
\end{table}

\newpage
\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The following approaches will be used to verify the SRS:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ad hoc Peer Review}: Informal reviews of the SRS will be conducted after every major revision 
  to the SRS with classmates who will serve as peer reviewers. This will provide new perspectives that can 
  help identify ambiguities, missing requirements and/or areas of improvement. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Peer reviewers will submit feedback using GitHub issue tracker for organized task assignment and tracking.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Supervisor Review}: Before every major SRS revision submission, the team will 
  send a copy of the SRS to the project supervisor a week before meeting, along with a checklist highlighing 
  priority areas for their feedback. The team will also prepare questions about the requirements related to 
  interfaces and usability which is the supervisor's area of expertise. During the review meeting, the team will 
  first review the supervisor's initial feedback with the supervisor, and then ask the prepared questions.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The meeting notes will be documented using GitHub issue tracker.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Internal Team Walkthrough}: The team will hold a collaborative session 
  before every major SRS revision submission where the team will discuss each section one 
  by one to verify that all requirements are understood by all members, and that each section 
  is consistent with the project goals/objectives. A checklist will act as a guide to highlight the key concepts 
  the review should focus on, and will help ensure no critical areas are missed in review. The checklist can be found 
  below.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Any corrections or modifications that need to be made will be noted in the team 
    meeting's GitHub issue tracker.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The following checklist will be used for the internal team walkthrough: \\
\begin{todolist}
  \item Are all major functions required for the website (interface, backend, recording, analysis, storage) covered?
  \item Does each function have clear input and output specifications?
  \item Are all requirements written with consistent terminology?
  \item Do all requirements avoid conflict with each other?
  \item Does each requirement avoid ambiguous language?
  \item Are all requirements verifiable and testable?
  \item Is each requirement written in a way all team members and stakeholders can understand?
  \item Are any assumptions about user behavior or system behaviour explicitly stated?
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}


The design verification plan outlines the strategies that the team will use to verify the usability and correctness of our
 system. The following outlines the plan for verifying the User Interface of the software as captured by system design
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shall conduct a quick review with supervisor after design documents (MIS) have been completed 
  \item Conduct peer review sessions from classmates to provide critical suggestions on improvements of the system. 
  \item Conduct final formal review with clinician Dr. Du and the team, following defined SRS and MIS documents. 
  \item Conduct ad-hoc review(s) with other teams.
\end{itemize}

The following checklist will be used to verify the system's design documents over the course of completion.
\begin{todolist}
\item Are all requirements traceable to at least one feature/module in the MIS?
\item Do all modules and components follow SOLID design principles?
\item Have the creation of all modules been tracked via issues and closed once reviewed?
\item Are all inputs and outputs of system components defined well and correctly?
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

As the verification and validation plan is an artifact, it must be verified too. The team's verification of the VnV plan follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Peer reviews by classmates, including other teams' peer reviews, to identify areas of improvement and general feedback
  \item Documentation review by the project's supervisor, Dr. Irene Ye Yuan, to ensure that the team's planned verification and validation plan is realistic and feasible
  \item Teammate documentation reviews, to provide critical feedback and ensure that all intended goals and outcomes are met
  \item Mutation testing to ensure that changes to aspects of the source plan can be detected by test cases.
\end{itemize}

The below checklist will be used, in addition, to ensure the team's VnV plan is correct and complete.

\begin{todolist}
\item Does the VnV Plan verify all functional requirements are met?
\item Does the VnV Plan verify all non-functional requirements are met?
\item Have all peer-review issues been addressed and closed?
\item Have all members of the Verification and Validation Team contributed to the review and approved the document?
\item Are all aspects of the system boundary being verified, validated, and tested?
\item Do the system tests cover all requirements mentioned in the SRS?
\item Did the test cases detect mutations and give desired outputs?
\item Did the test cases' expected output match the actual output?
\item Is there a process for documenting and resolving defects?
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The following outlines the plan for verifying implementation of the system, using both static and dynamic techniques 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Walkthrough of key components of the system with the supervisor (UI design, user authentication, video and audio analysis)
  \item Walkthrough of each components with other teammates 
  \item Running unit tests (to be implemented in VnV Plan) to verify that the implementation matches the specified design 
  outlined in MIS. This will be done automatically (dynamic) using Github Actions for each pull request made, following
  CI/CD principles. 
  \item Running system tests (both functional and non functional) described in the VnV plan to verify that the implementation 
  meets requirements
  \item Running Static analyzers including linters to help discover any potential errors or bugs in the code. Linters 
  and tools will also be used to help make the code more organized and readable. 
  \item Major code commits will be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging to main branch to ensure
   consistency and minimize chance of conflicts. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

The following are the automated testing and verification tools to be used during the validation and 
verification process for the software being tested in this VnV plan:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Unit Tests: Jest, Pytest
  \item Linters: Flake9, Prettier, ESLint
  \item Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions
\end{itemize}
\hspace{2em} For our code coverage, we will use Istanbul and Coverage.py. Istanbul is a code coverage 
tool that works with JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest. It helps developers see how much of their 
code is tested by creating reports that show untested lines and functions. Coverage.py is a code coverage 
tool for Python, which we use for our machine learning model. It measures how much of the code runs during 
tests and generates reports in different formats, helping developers find untested parts of their Python 
applications and improve test coverage.


\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Our plan for validating the software includes review sessions with 
stakeholders and extensive user testing. Dr.Yao Du, one of our key 
stakeholders, will provide the software to clinicians and patients for 
real-world testing in clinical settings. This will allow us to gather 
valuable feedback on the softwareâ€™s functionality and usability in 
actual healthcare environments. In addition to this field testing, we 
will conduct structured user testing sessions where participants will 
simulate the experience of being a patient. During these sessions, 
users will navigate through the software, interacting with its features,
and afterward, they will share their insights on what worked well and 
what didnâ€™t. Overall, using both field testing and targeted user testing, the information
gathered will help us refine the 
software and ensure it meets the needs of its intended users. 

\newpage
\section{System Tests}
\hspace{2em}This section includes systems tests for functional requirements and nonfunctional
requirements mentioned in the SRS. For traceability, the team created a traceability
matrix to correlate the system tests to the requirement(s) they cover.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
\hspace{2em}The following section covers all the functional requirements specified in the project's
SRS document. Each of the functional requirements are covered by a test in section 4.1. The coverage
can be traced in Table 3.

\subsubsection{Authentication}

\hspace{2em}The test cases below focus on ensuring users can safely and securely login, create and access
their accounts without worrying about others accessing their information.

  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Parisha: The work of the VnV plan was divided very well, 
  with team members working on testing of non functional and functional requirements that match
  the ones they worked on for the SRS document. This made it a lot more efficient and easier to understand
  what to write for the testing requirements. \\\\
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One of the things that went well during this deliverable was splitting up
  the System Tests for both Functional Requirements and Nonfunctional Requirements. The team decided
  to assign the functional and nonfunctional tests to the team members that wrote those particular
  requirements in the SRS. This allowed the team to use their prior knowledge on the requirements
  to develop detailed test plans to accurately test the requirements. This also meant that team members
  that were familiar with the requirements knew the limitations of the tests, and could improve upon
  given feedback to strengthen the plan further.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: I think the team worked well together as usual, especially when it came to 
  distributing tasks. Our team was very efficient and decided to split test cases for the functional and 
  nonfunctional requirements in the same way we split up writing the requirements for the SRS, and the 
  rest of the document was split up fairly quickly within a team meeting. Another thing that went well 
  while writing this deliverable is organization. Now that we have written several pieces of documentation, 
  the team is comfortable navigating LaTex formatting, as well as GitHub project and issue tracking.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Promish: One thing that went well during this deliverable was how 
  comfortable everyone became using GitHub. We created issues for each task, and 
  handling merge conflicts was faster. As a team, we quickly divided the work, 
  understanding that writing system tests for the requirements each of us specialized in 
  was the most efficient approach. We also recognized the importance of consistent naming 
  for our tests to maintain traceability with our SRS, so we decided to include "ST" in 
  the middle of our SRS requirements tags.\\\\
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Parisha: A challenge I found was due to time constraints and responsibilities
   in other classes it become very hard to coordinate meetings with all members of the team. 
   In order to optimize our time, team members communicated progress consistently and we worked together
    in the end to merge branches ( a lot of merge conflicts due to structure) and then reviewed the documentation
    against rubric and added reflection \\\\
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One of the pain points I experienced during this deliverable was understanding the
  format needed for the System Tests section. I found it difficult to get started because of the formality
  of the tests. As well, I wanted to make sure that the tests were consistent among team members, and a difference
  in formatting would be difficult for someone reading the document to understand. To resolve this, the team decided
  to follow a consistent formatting outline, and follow along a sample so that everyone knew what test cases
  should look like for this deliverable.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: One pain point during this deliverable was clarification of document instructions, 
  such as what area testing is or what exactly the symbolic constraints were. We resolved this by preparing 
  questions to ask the TA during our informal TA meeting, and looking at examples from other capstone projects 
  from the same course completed in previous years.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Promish: A challenge we faced during this deliverable was the 
  large number of tests we had to write within a limited timeframe. With only a week 
  to work on the document, we didnâ€™t have time for extra meetings with our advisor and 
  TA to clarify certain sections as much as I would have liked. Overall, the team did a 
  great job with the time and resources available, but some parts of the document were a 
  bit unclear, especially regarding formatting and focus. The rubric was also quite 
  general, making it harder to understand the exact requirements.\\\\
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Parisha: One piece of knowledge and skills the team should acquire for the project is a good understanding 
  of all the different types of testing like static, dynamic, manual, automatic and functional testing. Understanding the difference
  between these types and what cases are the best to use them are important to design correct and efficient tests for the system.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One of the pieces of knowledge and skills the team collectively needs to acquire to 
  successfully complete the verification and validation of the project is understanding how to properly perform
  usability testing. This will be important to the team because it is one of the project's chosen extras, so understanding
  usability testing is crucial for the success of the project. As well, it will inform us on how users actually engage,
  interact, and understand our system. Another skill the team will need to acquire is dynamic testing using different frameworks.
  It will be beneficial to perform dynamic testing to get verify each of our desired outcomes of tests against the actual outcomes.
  This will provide the team with accurate, reliable results and conclusions.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: The team will need skills in both dynamic and static testing to successfully complete the 
  verification and validation of the project, including knowledge of effective test case creation and debugging. 
  Being familiar with tools like automated test frameworks and static analysis tools that our team can use for our 
  project will be important to improving efficiency and accuracy in our testing processes. Additionally, understanding 
  quality assurance practices and common code review techniques will help make sure our validation is thorough and reliable. \\\\
  \hspace{2em} Promish: As a team, weâ€™ll need to focus on learning to use the frameworks outlined 
  in section 3.6 to automate our unit tests. Weâ€™ll also need to understand how to evaluate our 
  SRS and the processes for making changes. Lastly, weâ€™ll need to know where testing fits 
  into continuous development and how to follow Agile practices effectively.\\\\
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Parisha: One approach to acquire knowledge specially in manual vs automatic testing is using course material from our Software Testing course SFWRENG 3S03
  to get a good summary of the different between the two and find some small examples/ practice problems to go through from tutorial to refresh our memory/ 
  Another good approach would be to use testing modules online (such as Geeks4Geeks) to understand the different types of testing with good examples.
  I will be using approach 2 to acquire knowledge as I learn best with a combination of reading, watching and doing. \\\\
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One approach to acquire knowledge for usability testing is referring to SFWRENG 4HC3 course notes,
  as usability testing is one of the major topics the course focuses on, with lots of examples and details. To obtain knowledge for dynamic tests, I plan on learning pytest to learn about dynamic testing in Python, which will be the
  team's language of choice for developing machine learning models.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: I will choose to focus on static testing knowledge since it is something I usually overlook 
  and would like to improve on. To acquire knowledge in static testing, one approach would be to use online static 
  testing tutorials and resources, especially platforms with specialized online courses such as Coursera or Udacity. 
  Another approach would be to use an open-source static analysis tool and apply it to previous projects or example 
  codebases to get hands on experience identifying common code issues, warnings, and even security vulnerabilities.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Promish: One of the best ways to learn a framework is to read its 
  documentation or watch YouTube tutorials. After that, testing it out in a separate IDE 
  with a small example would be helpful for something like Pytest. For a better 
  understanding of Agile development, we could look into resources that explain Agile 
  principles and methods. Additionally, consulting our TA, supervisor, and professor 
  would be valuable for understanding how our team can function effectively.\\\\
