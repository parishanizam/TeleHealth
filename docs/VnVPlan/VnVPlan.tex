\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

  The software being tested TeleHealth Insights, is a web-based at-home bilingual
  speech assessment system with video and audio analysis features. The system is designed to provide clear 
  guidance to parents when administering the assessment to their children, in an environment where speech-language
  pathologists (SLPs) are unavailable. By streamlining the assessment pro-
  cess, the project aims to provide a convenient and comprehensive solution
  for SLPs to assess and support their patient's speech and language development remotely.

  TeleHealth System comprises of several software components to efficiently provide 
  a platform for children assessments to occur while actively recording for clinicians to review and analyze. 

  \subsubsection{User Interface}

  We must ensure that the interface is easy to navigate for all stakeholders involved, the parents, 
  clinicians as well as the parents. The system should be simple and testing will include ensuring 
  there is an intuitive layouts, clear instructions and labels, as well as a logical workflow.

  \subsubsection{Video and Audio Recording}

  Ensure set up of hardware devices used on application is intuitive and done properly. 

  \subsubsection{Video and Audio Analysis}

  Integrate web-based application to store recorded audio and video footage. The system will be tested to ensure it is able to 
  appropriately analyze and identify flags and bias when conducting assessments. The analyzed data should be presented 
  in a easy to understand representation

\subsection{Objectives}


The Vnv Plan will focus on the following objectives
\subsubsection{Ensure Accuracy and Correctness of Software Reading and Identifying Bias}
The main objective of this VnV Plan is ensure correctness of the system's ability to 
record video and audio of our clients completing speech therapy assessments, store and train an AI model to 
to be able to detect any disturbances and bias in the assessment taking process. A report or dashboard should be made to present its findings and ensure the results are accurate.


\subsubsection{Security and Authentication}

Second main objective of this VnV plan is to ensure security and strong authentication capabilities of the software. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Check security and anonymity of all patient data (recording), ensuring its secure storage of information and access.
  \item Check software correctness, ensuring authorized users are allowed in the system, and their appropriate role. 
  \subitem{Parents should be able to view the assessment and complete it with their child.}
  \subitem{Clinicians should be able to view assessment results and recordings}
  \subitem{Admins should be able to view and create accounts.}
  \item Check the software correctly blocked unauthorized users and grants them access to the assessment portal and assessment results.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Demonstrate Usability}
The last main object of the VnV plan is to check that the application is easy and intuitive to use. The main goal of the system is to create an application that stores correct results and allows users to complete their task quickly and efficiently. 
Given that the system will be used by parents, children, and medical professionals, the UI needs to be easy to understand and use. 


Out of scope Objectives 

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}


\subsubsection{Challenge Level} 

Our challenge level is general as the project scope is limited in terms of how much
research is required. The required domain knowledge is basic web-design in a
stack of our choice. We are also planning on using open-source large language
models for audio and video processing.

\subsubsection{Extras}
Our project has the following extras;
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User Documentation: } Providing users with a guide on how to use and
  better understand the system. 
  \item \textbf{Usability Testing: } Receive user feedback on usability of design of the ap-
plication, including improvements on how the system looks and functions. This will help to ensure an intuitive and easy system for both clinicians and parents/children to navigate through.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

  The two main relevant documentation that helped guide us in System Verification and Validation Plan (VnV) was Software Requirements Specification
  (SRS) and Development plan.  
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The SRS document was crucial to define descriptions, rationals and fit criteria for all of the systems main functional and non functional requirements. This outlines the basis of what needs to be verified and tested in the VnV Plan. 
    \item Development Plan: Defined the main Goals, Objectives and extras for the system, aiding the team to understand what needs to be done and focused on. 
  \end{itemize}
  

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}


The design verification plan outlines the strategies that the team will use to verify the usability and correctness of our system. The following outlines the plan for verifying the User Interface of the software. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shall conduct a quick review with supervisor after design documents (MIS) have been completed 
  \item Conduct peer review sessions from classmates to provide critical suggestions on improvements of the system. 
  \item Conduct final formal review with clinician Dr. Du and the team, following defined SRS and MIS documents. 
\end{itemize}

The following checklist will be used to verify the system's design documents \\
\checkbox Are all requirements traceable to at least one feature/module in the MIS? \\
\checkbox Do all modules and components follow SOLID design principles? \\
\checkbox Have the creation of all modules been tracked via issues and closed once reviewed? \\


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

The following outlines the plan for verifying implementation of the system, using both static and dynamic techniques 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Walkthrough of key components of the system with the supervisor (UI design, user authentication, video and audio analysis)
  \item Walkthrough of each components with other teammates 
  \item Running unit tests (to be implemented in VnV Plan) to verify that the implementation matches the specified design outlined in MIS. This will be done automatically (dynamic) using Github Actions for each pull request made, following
  \item Running system tests (both functional and non functional) described in the VnV plan to verify that the implementation meets requirements
  \item Running Static analyzers including linters to help discover any potential errors or bugs in the code. Linters and tools will also be used to help make the code more organized and readable. 
  \item Major code commits will be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging to main branch to ensure consistency and minimize chance of conflicts. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

  be automatic}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
