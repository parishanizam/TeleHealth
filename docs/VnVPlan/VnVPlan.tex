\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\newpage

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

The following approaches will be used to verify the SRS:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ad hoc Peer Review}: Informal reviews of the SRS will be conducted after every major revision 
  to the SRS with classmates who will serve as peer reviewers. This will provide new perspectives that can 
  help identify ambiguities, missing requirements and/or areas of improvement. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Peer reviewers will submit feedback using GitHub issue tracker for organized task assignment and tracking.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Supervisor Review}: Before every major SRS revision submission, the team will 
  send a copy of the SRS to the project supervisor a week before meeting, along with a checklist highlighing 
  priority areas for their feedback. The team will also prepare questions about the requirements related to 
  interfaces and usability which is the supervisor's area of expertise. During the review meeting, the team will 
  first review the supervisor's initial feedback with the supervisor, and then ask the prepared questions.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The meeting notes will be documented using GitHub issue tracker.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Internal Team Walkthrough}: The team will hold a collaborative session 
  before every major SRS revision submission where the team will discuss each section one 
  by one to verify that all requirements are understood by all members, and that each section 
  is consistent with the project goals/objectives. A checklist will act as a guide to highlight the key concepts 
  the review should focus on, and will help ensure no critical areas are missed in review. The checklist can be found 
  below.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Any corrections or modifications that need to be made will be noted in the team 
    meeting's GitHub issue tracker.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The following checklist will be used for the internal team walkthrough: \\
\begin{todolist}
  \item Are all major functions required for the website (interface, backend, recording, analysis, storage) covered?
  \item Does each function have clear input and output specifications?
  \item Are all requirements written with consistent terminology?
  \item Do all requirements avoid conflict with each other?
  \item Does each requirement avoid ambiguous language?
  \item Are all requirements verifiable and testable?
  \item Is each requirement written in a way all teawm members and stakeholders can understand?
  \item Are any assumptions about user behavior or system behaviour explicity stated?
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

As the verification and validation plan is an artifact, it must be verified too. The team's verification of the VnV plan follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Peer reviews by classmates, including other teams' peer reviews, to identify areas of improvement and general feedback
  \item Documentation review by the project's supervisor, Dr. Irene Ye Yuan, to ensure that the team's planned verification and validation plan is realistic and feasible
  \item Teammate documentation reviews, to provide critical feedback and ensure that all intended goals and outcomes are met
  \item Mutation testing to ensure that changes to aspects of the source plan can be detected by test cases.
\end{itemize}

The below checklist will be used, in addition, to ensure the team's VnV plan is correct and complete.

\begin{todolist}
\item Does the VnV Plan verify all functional requirements are met?
\item Does the VnV Plan verify all non-functional requirements are met?
\item Have all peer-review issues been addressed and closed?
\item Have all members of the Verification and Validation Team contributed to the review and approved the document?
\item Are all aspects of the system boundary being verified, validated, and tested?
\item Do the system tests cover all requirements mentioned in the SRS?
\item Did the test cases detect mutations and give desired outputs?
\item Did the test cases' expected output match the actual output?
\item Is there a process for documenting and resolving defects?
\end{todolist}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements. References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
\subsubsection{Authentication}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\hspace{2em}The test cases below focus on ensuring users can safely and securely login, create and access
their accounts without worrying about others accessing their information.

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One of the things that went well during this deliverable was splitting up
  the System Tests for both Functional Requirements and Nonfunctional Requirements. The team decided
  to assign the functional and nonfunctional tests to the team members that wrote those particular
  requirements in the SRS. This allowed the team to use their prior knowledge on the requirements
  to develop detailed test plans to accurately test the requirements. This also meant that team members
  that were familiar with the requirements knew the limitations of the tests, and could improve upon
  given feedback to strengthen the plan further.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: I think the team worked well together as usual, especially when it came to 
  distributing tasks. Our team was very efficient and decided to split test cases for the functional and 
  nonfunctional requirements in the same way we split up writing the requirements for the SRS, and the 
  rest of the document was split up fairly quickly within a team meeeting. Another thing that went well 
  while writing this deliverable is organzation. Now that we have written several pieces of documentation, 
  the team is comfortable navigating LaTex formatting, as well as GitHub project and issue tracking.\\
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One of the pain points I experienced during this deliverable was understanding the
  format needed for the System Tests section. I found it difficult to get started because of the formality
  of the tests. As well, I wanted to make sure that the tests were consistent among team members, and a difference
  in formatting would be difficult for someone reading the document to understand. To resolve this, the team decided
  to follow a consistent formatting outline, and follow along a sample so that everyone knew what test cases
  should look like for this deliverable.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: One pain point during this deliverable was clarification of document instructions, 
  such as what area testing is or what exactly the symbolic constraints were. We resolved this by preparing 
  questions to ask the TA during our informal TA meeting, and looking at examples from other capstone projects 
  from the same course completed in previous years.\\\\
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One of the pieces of knowledge and skills the team collectively needs to acquire to 
  successfully complete the verification and validation of the project is understanding how to properly perform
  usability testing. This will be important to the team because it is one of the project's chosen extras, so understanding
  usability testing is crucial for the success of the project. As well, it will inform us on how users actually engage,
  interact, and understand our system. Another skill the team will need to acquire is dynamic testing using different frameworks.
  It will be beneficial to perform dynamic testing to get verify each of our desired outcomes of tests against the actual outcomes.
  This will provide the team with accurate, reliable results and conclusions.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: The team will need skills in both dynamic and static testing to successfully complete the 
  verification and validation of the project, including knowledge of effective test case creation and debugging. 
  Being familiar with tools like automated test frameworks and static analysis tools that our team can use for our 
  project will be important to improving efficiency and accuracy in our testing processes. Additionally, understanding 
  quality assurance practices and common code review techniques will help make sure our validation is thorough and reliable. \\\\
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?\\
  \newline
  \hspace{2em} Mitchell: One approach to acquire knowledge for usability testing is referring to SFWRENG 4HC3 course notes,
  as usability testing is one of the major topics the course focuses on, with lots of examples and details. To obtain knowledge for dynamic tests, I plan on learning pytest to learn about dynamic testing in Python, which will be the
  team's language of choice for developing machine learning models.\\\\
  \hspace{2em} Jasmine: I will choose to focus on static testing knowledge since it is something I usually overlook 
  and would like to improve on. To acquire knowledge in static testing, one approach would be to use online static 
  testing tutorials and resources, especially platforms with specialized online courses such as Coursera or Udacity. 
  Another approach would be to use an open-source static analysis tool and apply it to previous projects or example 
  codebases to get hands on experience identifying common code issues, warnings, and even security vulnerabilities.\\\\
